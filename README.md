# Installation
This project has not been published to PyPi yet. You could simple clone this repo and install it using pip.

        cd pydoclint/
        pip install .

# Supported Features
Currently only spell check is supported. However, the intention is add the following formatting verification for docstring. The ambition is to add grammar check check. However, I am not sure if it is going to happen anytime soon :(.

# Usage
After installation use the following command.

        ./doclint <path to file or directory>

If a directory is provided, doclint will find all python file in that directory and start verification.

# Todo
- Problems in running the command needs to be fixed
- Support configuration overriding defined as pylint (.pylintrc)

# Notes
- The project is in early development phase. Some features may not work as intended.
- Contact me if you want to be involved in the development.
